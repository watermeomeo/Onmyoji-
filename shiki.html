						<h1>ASURA</h1>
						<p>Asura only casts Endless Slaughter if he manages to KO an enemy unit and does not regain 9 Sanity by his next turn. If his Sanity is spent from casting skill 3 but a KO did not occur, then his Sanity points will be automatically restored to 9 at the start of his next turn.
Asura can play the piccolo.

Asura's contradiction is the choice he must make about who he is (hero of Celestials vs Mara of Abyss). At the end of the story, Asura crushed his Celestial Locus, became complete after stating "because I am only Asura".
Asura was partly inspired by a historical king.
Originally Asura had black armor in the story, so the Taishakuten would refer to him as a warrior in black. But later, while designing the art, got rid of armor to make him look more exotic, and settled for clothes that complemented darker skin tones instead.
Asura's appearance is savage externally, but on the inside he is forthcoming and brave, values friendship, yearns for warmth, is open to his friends, and wants to protect his family. However, his brutal powers will kill all his loved ones. He was born as the Mara in the darkness, but still desired the light, and so filled dual roles of hero and villain.
Efforts were made to show his strength in battle, how he had an aura of fierceness and valiance. Elements selected were inspired by the "six-armed" asuras in mythology, which was represented by the six tentacles of his Spiritual Entity. Also borrowed from how asuras were considered gods of war and destruction.
Asura possesses unparalleled power, but what he values most are ordinary and simple emotions. He was always looking for someone who can fill his heart, so this contrast informed his core self.
Asura's tentacles can shift into various forms, so he often changes them into various weapons to accommodate different situations.
Asura's third eye can see through all illusions and falsehoods, an invincible buff but with limits. This will play an important role in later plot.
Taishakuten and Asura's relationship is described as "intimate friendship"; the missing parts of the two are precisely the strengths of each other, they reflect and complement one another.</p>

						<h1>OROCHI</h1>
						<p>He's a powerful evil god from Takamagahara who was once sealed in the rift between two worlds. The downfall of humans is no different to the falling of cherry blossoms in his eyes. He learned to cheat and lie to humans, and made a deal with the onmyoji of Heian-kyo.
							<br>
							Orochi has both PvP and PvE use so definitely worth building.
He’s easier to use in PvE since soul requirement is much lower. He can run through a few secret zones with relative ease.

In PvP, he’s more for fast teams to do a few attack waves right off the bat. For slower teams to use him, he’ll need some Effect RES to counter controlling shikigamis.

Overall, he is definitely a powerful unit worthy of your Black Darumas. Afterall, he is the arch enemy and the first unit with an SS in stats.
							<br>
							Kamaitachi, SP Shuten, Kaguya, Takiyashahime, Orochi, with Kagura
This is a pretty standard team that uses Orochi’s Unholy Force to pull Takiyashahime after she attacks the first time. The Kagura pulls again. Takiyashahime can attack 3 times in the first wave if there is enough orb. There are quite a few counters to this team but this set up ranks up in Duel quite fast if Kamaitachi is fast enough. Doesn’t work well in higher tier Duels so use with caution.

						<h1>TAISHAKUTEN</h1>
						<p>Celestial arc development interview from the official blog, translated and summarised here (credit to 500scnds).

Taishakuten's core setting took "opposing dualities" to the extreme: compassion in early story vs cruel mania as king; purity of appearance vs brutal actions; becoming the good of the world bearing the evil of the world; main design element consisting of white lotuses for character that is full of sin, etc.
Design notes: the unstained lotus growing from mud, reincarnation, the six paths of Samsara. Taishakuten appeared compassionate, but acted as a cruel ruler - emphasis on duality. The more insane his ideals and methods, the greater the need for purity and grace in his appearance. He bore so much sin, yet retained his purity of spirit.
Taishakuten's lotuses early on had the abilities of purification, defense and mind reading. Later, they can create illusions, psychological control, and have offensive capabilities.
As a young child Taishakuten sealed the true power of his Spiritual Entity until it was awakened by meeting Asura, and subsequent life-or-death situations.
The eyes on Taishakuten's body are related to his Spiritual Entity, they are used to perceive others' thoughts and synthesize sense.
Taishakuten is described as both "sincere and insane", however his heart had never changed throughout time.
Taishakuten and Asura's relationship is described as "intimate friendship"; the missing parts of the two are precisely the strengths of each other, they reflect and complement one another.
