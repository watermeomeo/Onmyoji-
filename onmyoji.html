				<h1>SEIMEI</h1>
				<p>Seimei is thinking to himself near the nether rift about Kuro Seimei and his plans. He subconsciously discovers that the rift between the mortal and spirit world has the power to subvert the order of Heaven and Earth. Only a powerful onmyouji like Abe no Seimei could achieve this. An ominous voice agrees with Seimei to get rid of his “dark side” and Seimei orders his Shikigami to lend him strength.</p>
				<h3>Mt. Gloom</h3>
				<p>Kagura, Hiromasa, Seimei, Kohkau and Yaobikuni arrive at The Balck Tortoise realm after discussing how three of the other realms were taken over by Kuro Seimei. Hiromasa believes Seimei proved himself trustworthy and is just about to reveal his knowledge of Kagura to Seimei when Kagura interrupts them. They don’t finish the conversation and move on. Seimei promises Yaobikuni to make her mortal again. Seimei and Kagura savour their memory on Mt Gloom, the first time they met. Suddenly a strange Kyuumei Neko attacks them. Whilst Seimei is worrying about the rapid spread of the netherforce, Yaobikuni offers to See the location of Dark Seimei. As a result of the over exertion of her powers, she ushers the reluctant Seimei, Kagura and Kohaku to go on with out her before it was too late. After they are out of sight, Yao bikuni reveals that her body is extremely powerful for her liking.</p>
				<h3>Ootengu</h3>
				<p>The group encounter Ootengu who finally reveals his and Kuro Seimei’s intentions by revenging against humans. Ootengu’s overwhelming nether force threatens to take over them but Kagura shields them shocking Hiromasa and Seimei. On top of that Kohaku transforms into the guardian spirit of Mt. Gloom, briefly stunning Ootengu. In his weakened state Seimei attacks. After his defeat, Hiromasa finishes Ootengu off.</p>
				<h3>Dark Seimei</h3>
				<p>As Seimei, Kagura, Kohaku and Hiromasa continue on, Seimei explains that they have arrived at the Netherworld gate; the same place Seimei and Kagura found themselves after their memory losses. Dark Seimei reveals himself taunting them and musing at his own victories. He injures Kagura, Kohaku and Hiromasa and continues to perform the World Upheaval Spell leaving Seimei in despair and helplessness.</p>
				<h3>Merger</h3>
				<p>Seimei wakes up in a dark place and sees his child self listening to his mother who was teaching him about the art of Onmyoudo. She expresses her concerns of his great power. She warns little Seimei to never try to change the natural order of the world. Seimei remembers the day he split him self into two people with the Onmyou Divisive Spell. Seimei discovers that Kuro Seimei grew from his despair and hatred. Upon rejecting Kuro Seimei’s offer, he stabs his hand into Seimei’s heart to devour his power. They are interrupted by Yao Bikuni which deeply angers Dark Seimei.</p>

				<h1>KAGURA</h1>
				<p>Kohaku calls out to Seimei, but he is distracted. Kohaku wonders why Seimei is spacing out, is it because of his amnesia again? Seimei explains that he was thinking about the amnesiac he recently started taking care of, Kagura. Kohaku thinks that she must not be ordinary person and that noone knows what she's thinking. Kagura appears in search of Seimei: a guest has appeared. It is Inugami, here to take revenge on Seimei. They fight before the onmyoji has a chance to make sense of what is going on. Seimei wins.</p>
				<h3>The Whole Story</h3>
				<p>Kohaku inquires after Seimei's condition. Seimei admits that Inugami is quite strong, as his strength was enhanced after becoming influence by an air of resentment. Inugami, to everyone's surprise, rises again to attack Seimei, but is stopped by Kagura. Kohaku is amazed by Kagura's display of sorcery, but Seimei stops her before she kills Inugami. Kagura then collapses, but she assures Seimei that she will soon recover. Kohaku comments on her extreme healing speed, but even Kagura is not sure why. Inugami eventually awakens, and Kagura suggests for him to clarify the situation. Inugami stoically tells them to just kill him, and expresses his regret that he cannot take revenge for "Suzume." Seimei repeats that he is unaware of the situation. Inugami scoffs at this, but recounts his story, accusing Kohaku of eating "Suzume," and Seimei of ordering him to do it. They discuss this, and Kagura has a plan to absolve Kohaku of suspicion, wanting to visit Suzume's site of death. Inugami is still convinced that Seimei is guilty, but Seimei swears as an onmyoji to Shinra Bansho to the contrary. Inugami leads the way as Kagura reveals her plan to "talk" to the deceased.</p>
				<h3>Forest Investigation </h3>
				<p>All arrive at the location of Suzume's death. Seimei plans to search for clues, but Kagura warns him of potential monsters lurking about just as one appears to attack. After the fight, Kagura suggests to search for remnants of Suzume, so Seimei uses his spirit sight and sees a sleeping bakeneko, it is Kyumeineko. Inugami and Kyumeineko trade insults. As they ignore her, the group notices "Suzume's'" feather on the ground, and Kagura begins a ritual to summon him. Meanwhile, Seimei stops using his spirit sight and wonders about the relationship between Suzume and Inugami. Inugami explains that he was once a violent dog, but Suzume taught him about trust. To repay him, Inugami began cultivating and performing good deeds to achieve transcendence. Kagura finishes reibai and Suzume is summoned. They ask him who killed him, but Suzume recounts that it was someone that looks like Kohaku... but meowed. Kyumeineko confesses to eating Suzume, and plans to eat everyone to destroy the evidence. A fight ensues.</p>
				<h3>Drawing to a Close</h3>
				<p>Kyumeineko is defeated. Inugami and Suzume trade words and prepare to part. Seimei has a solution by turning Suzume into Inugami's guardian spirit. Inugami is overcome by joy. Kohaku is also absolved of guilt. To thank Seimei, Inugami offers to be Seimei's shikigami. On the way back, Inugami mentions that he believe Kohaku had eaten Suzume since someone told him. Later, Kyumeineko revives, declaring that for a cat with nine lives, losing one is no issue, but she will get her revenge on Seimei, as she is watched from the shadows. The unknown figure comments on her uselessness and proceeds to the next step of the plan...</p>

				<h1>HIROMASA</h1>
				<p>Seimei, Yaobikuni and Kohaku are in search of Kagura in Mt. Gloom. They meet Minamoto no Hiromasa for the first time and battling a beauty hungry yokai called Kamikui. He is quickly taken down by Hiromasa who then notices Seimei and immediately wants to challenge him. Kamigui escapes. At the end of the battle, he is surprised that Kagura doesnt recognise him and leaves. The group goes on to persuit Kamikui to prevent him from eating more souls and encounter the yokai Chouchin Obake who apparently was in league with Kamikui. The defeated yokai tells Seimei that he went deeper into the mountains. Kamikui is dissapointed that he was defeated and agrees to Seimei (whom he calls beautiful) to never harm anymore souls and returns to the Inkai world.</p>
				<h3>The Battle on Black Night Mountain</h3>
				<p>The company arrive at the Black Night Mountain, but Kohaku questions if they can really find Kagura this way. Yaobikuni is unable to determine Kagura's exact location, and as she rests, Seimei describes his past encounter with Kagura there. Suddenly they hear a sound, and discover a scene of battle. A young man is challenging Kamikui, but falls into a trap, only to escape it to defeat the surprised Kamikui. This man turns out to be Hiromasa. Seimei greets him, only to mysteriously enter conflict against him while Kamikui sees the chance to run away. After learning of Seimei's identity, Hiromasa becomes even more resolute to spar against Seimei, but the return of Kagura prevents that. Hiromasa is surprised that Kagura has the name she has. Kagura explains her whereabouts, and attributes to her being able to escape to Hiromasa's interference. Hiromasa doesn't think much of the act, but has now lost the mood to battle Seimei. Kohaku notes that Hiromasa is staring at Kagura a lot, but neither seem to have met each other before... Hiromasa leaves and the group returns to the task of subduing Kamikui.</p>
				<h3>Chasing Kamigui</h3>
				<p>The company find Kamikui's hideout, and receive information from the Soul of a dead woman: Kamikui is familiar with a certain lantern. They then find Chouchin Obake, who quickly loses composure and attacks them. Chouchin Obake however gets defeated, and is coerced to tell them that Kamikui has gone deeper into the mountains. They arrive to find that Kamikui has eaten other youkai to get stronger. The company dispute the ethics of this, and fight again Kamikui once more.</p>
				<h3>Another Tear </h3>
				<p>Kamikui loses and rages incredulousness at this turn of events. However, it is revealed that he isn't as strong as he's supposed to because he ate demons and not humans. Since the matter is resolved and Kamikui promised to not eat humans, Seimei doesn't push any matter further, only remarking that Kamikui should stop eating demons. Kamikui agrees and returns to the Inkai, and the company prepare to return. However, they meet Shiromujou and Kuromujou, they bring with them news that the place where Kamikui was able to enter the Yang world wasn't the only place with a tear from the Inkai. The onitsuka duly sealed them, but felt that something was still off and warned the onmyouji to not approach in the meantime. With this, they say their goodbyes and depart.</p>

				<h1>YAO BIKUNI</h1>
				<p>Seimei, Kagura and Kohaku enter Phoenix forest encountering Hōōka and find Yaobikuni.</p>
				<h3>Hōōka's Request </h3>
				<p>Everyone comments on the dreariness of the place. A hermit asks about their business in the forest, and Seimei asks him if there were any strange occurrences. The hermit mentions that someone recently moved into the deep forest, where people typically do not trespass. Uponing mentioning the diviner, the hermit also mentions that there is a shrine for the phoenix as well. Oddly, he saw the same young woman decades ago. The companions are in disbelief and search elsewhere. Seimei activates his spirit sight and is confronted by a yokai. Kohaku happens on a phoenix down, when Hōōka appears and challenges them. Hōōka acknowledges their strength and requests them to make the person at the shrine leave the forest, as she is unable to. Puzzled by her request, they nonetheless continue on, except Seimei now has to go alone.</p>
				<h3>Yaobikuni </h3>
				<p>Seimei notes the thickening air of yin and commands the unknown figure to reveal themselves. The unknown figure greets him as the "destined person." As it turns out, Yaobikuni has been cursed and wants to die. Seimei refuses, but Yaobikuni expects this, and tells him about the shrine. The spell cast over the shrine was broken midway, causing the air of yin to accumulate. At this point, Kagura and Kohaku finally find the two. And after understanding the situation, they investigate the spell. Yaobikuni is capable of removing it, but in return she requests Seimei to kill her. Seimei hesitates, and sees an evil spirit with his spirit sight. Hōōka reappears, and emphasizes the need for Yaobikuni to leave.</p>
				<h3>Leaving the Phoenix Forest</h3>
				<p>Yaobikuni proceeds to destroy the spell, much to Seimei's alarm, but she doesn't die, as she is immortal. Her prophetic dream informs her that Seimei is the only one able to kill her, but Seimei has no idea. Therefore, she moves into Seimei's house in wait for her death despite Kagura's apprehension. Hoo no Hi notes that something else is sleeping in Yaobikuni's icy Soul, while promising to meet Seimei once more.</p>
